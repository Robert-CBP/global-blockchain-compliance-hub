### Taxation of cryptocurrencies
Any gains realized by a Luxembourg resident individual holder of virtual currencies acquired less than six months before their conversion into any official currency (e.g. Euros) could be treated as speculative gains (bénéfice de spéculation) and be liable to income tax (at a maximum rate of 43.6%, including a 9% surcharge for employment funds). Capital gains held for more than six months are exempt from income tax.
