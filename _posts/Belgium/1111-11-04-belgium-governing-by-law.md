### Parliamentary discussion on cryptocurrencies
The Belgian government (including its central bank and financial markets supervisor) has been warning several times for the risks related to investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In April 2017, the minister of justice announced that existing laws for criminal prosecution in the financial sector will also apply to cryptocurrencies. With this measure he aims to be at the forefront among European countries. They are furthermore working to advance its technologies to track down cryptocurrencies and expanding possibilities to confiscate cryptocurrencies.
